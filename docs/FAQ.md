# Frequently asked questions

Make sure you check this before making an issue.

## NSP installs

- **I keep getting 'invalid NCA (missing sigpatches)' error...**

  Check that:

  - The NSP is converted from XCI (using tools like 4NXCI)? Then you need extra patches.
  
  - Do you have all the required patches?

    If you have just updated to a new console version and this error happens, try to redownload them.

  - Plain Atmosphere users: use The-4n's patches which can be found [here](https://gbatemp.net/threads/i-heard-that-you-guys-need-some-sweet-patches-for-atmosphere.521164/).

  - Kosmos users: make sure you have downloaded their patches from [here](https://github.com/Joonie86/hekate/releases). (they aren't directly included with Kosmos)

- **Goldleaf freezes and Quark/Goldtree doesn't respond/complains when I launch it...**

  - Do you have USB set-up correctly? Check how to do so [here](../README.md#quark-and-remote-pc).

    - If you do have USB corrently set-up, Quark shouldn't complain. If it does, try doing the setup again to ensure it is done fine.

  - Also, make sure you're launching Quark **after having launched Goldleaf. Goldleaf needs to be opened first.**

  - Are you using the latest version of both Goldleaf and Quark? Double-check it just in case, since this is a very common mistake.

- **I can't launch Quark / Quark is giving me errors on Linux...**

  - Quark is a little bit fucky on Linux. Check [here](QUARK_LINUX.md) for some more information about the matter.
